# Introduction
As has been covered in previous lectures/tutorials, plasmids can play a key role in the spread of antibiotic resistance. Plasmids are circular or linear double-stranded DNA molecules capable of autonomous replication and conjugation. So far, we have only covered prediction of AMR from presumably bacterial WGS assembly data. In this tutorial, we want to introduce methods/tools for detection of plasmids. However, we should note that plasmid detection using short read data can be diffcult and complex.
